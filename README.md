- Visual representation of hand landmarks on the webcam feed.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TensorFlow.js**: A library for machine learning in JavaScript.
- **HandPose Model**: A pre-trained model for detecting hand landmarks.
